## 🌟 Project Overview

This project is a modular, LLM-powered storytelling assistant built using Python and the OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo model. It was developed as part of a take-home prompt engineering assignment for Hippocratic AI.

The system generates creative, age-appropriate bedtime stories for children aged 5–10 based on user input. It then simulates a judging process to evaluate the story and offers automatic improvements when needed—all using prompt-driven AI agent simulation.
